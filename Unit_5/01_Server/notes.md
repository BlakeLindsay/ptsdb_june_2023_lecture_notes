# Getting Started
- Create a `package.json`
	- using the command `npm init`
		- Initializes our project
- create an `index.js`

- Install our Dependencies 
	- express: `npm install express`

If we ever need to, we can delete our `node_modules` folder safely. This may happen if a file is corrupted, if we make an edit, if something gets accidentally deleted or moved. If we want to recover our folder, we can delete the `node_modules` folder and run the command `npm install` in  our terminal.

- Ignore files using a `.gitignore`
	- `.gitignore` file will specify different files, folders, and file extensions that will NOT be tracked using git
